- Pregnancies: The more pregnancies a woman has, the higher her risk of developing diabetes.
- Glucose: High glucose levels are a sign of diabetes.
- BloodPressure: High blood pressure is a risk factor for diabetes.
- SkinThickness: Increased skin thickness is a sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes.
- Insulin: High insulin levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes.
- BMI: Obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A high diabetes pedigree function indicates a family history of diabetes, which increases the risk of developing the disease.
- Age: Age is a risk factor for diabetes.
