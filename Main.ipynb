    "## Train the linear model to predict the likelihood of each class from the binary vector\n",
    "When given the rules for each class and a sample, a simple method to measure the class likelihood of the sample is to count how many rules of each class it satisfies (i.e., the sum of the binary vector per class). However, not all rules carry the same importance, necessitating learning their significance from training samples.    \n",
